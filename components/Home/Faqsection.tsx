  {
    question: "How long does development take?",
    answer:
      "Most funnels go from kickoff to launch in 2–4 weeks, depending on scope. Simpler landing-page-plus-CRM setups can be ready in as little as 10 days, while fully custom automation builds take a bit longer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can it integrate with my CRM?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We connect directly with the CRM you already use, or set one up for you if you don't have one yet. Leads, follow-ups, and appointment data all sync automatically — no manual exporting or double entry.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build custom funnels?",
    answer:
      "Every funnel is designed around your specific offer, audience, and sales process — not a generic template. We map your customer journey first, then build the pages, automation, and follow-ups to match it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I own the funnel?",
    answer:
      "Yes, completely. Once it's built and handed over, the funnel, its pages, and all connected accounts belong to you. There's no lock-in — you're free to host, edit, or move it however you like.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate WhatsApp?",
    answer:
      "Yes. WhatsApp automation is one of our most-used integrations — instant lead replies, appointment reminders, and follow-up sequences can all run through it alongside email and SMS.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you redesign my existing funnel?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We can audit what you already have, identify where leads are dropping off, and rebuild or optimize the existing funnel instead of starting from scratch — whichever makes more sense for your situation.",
